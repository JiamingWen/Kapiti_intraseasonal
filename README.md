## Overview

This repository contains code for analyzing fast-changing intra-seasonal vegetation dynamics of drylands in the Horn of Africa (HoA) using solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) (Wen et al., 2025 Biogeosciences). In this study, We found that SIF from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) with daily revisit frequency identified highly dynamic week-to-week variations in both shrublands and grasslands; such rapid-changing vegetation dynamics corresponded to the up- and down- regulation by the fluctuations of environmental variables (e.g., air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, soil moisture). However, neither reconstructed SIF products nor near-infrared 
reflectance of terrestrial vegetation (NIRv) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which is widely used in literature, was able to capture such fast-changing intra-seasonal variations.
